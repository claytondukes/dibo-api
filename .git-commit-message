feat: GitHub Gist inventory system

- Add GitHub Gist integration for storing user inventories
- Add gist scope to OAuth permissions
- Add /auth/inventory endpoint to fetch user inventory
- Add comprehensive tests for inventory functionality
- Update documentation with Gist setup instructions
- Remove local registry.json in favor of Gist storage

This change moves user inventories from a local file to GitHub Gists,
providing a more secure and user-specific storage solution. Each user's
inventory is stored in their own gist named gems.json, which can be
either public or private.

Breaking Changes:
- Removed data/indexed/gems/registry.json
- OAuth now requires gist scope
