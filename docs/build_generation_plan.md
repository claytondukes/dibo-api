### 2. Data Models

#### Request Model
```python
class BuildRequest:
    build_type: BuildType      # raid, pve, pvp, farm
    focus: BuildFocus         # dps, survival, buff
    character_class: str      # e.g., "barbarian"
    inventory: Optional[Dict] = None
```

#### Skill Model
```python
class Skill:
    name: str
    base_type: str           # weapon, damage, control, buff, dash
    second_base_type: Optional[str]
    base_cooldown: str
    description: str
```

#### Class Constraints
```python
class ClassConstraints:
    skill_slots: Dict[str, List[str]]  # available_skills
    weapon_slots: Dict[str, List[str]]  # available_weapons
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Selection Algorithms

1. Skill Selection (`_select_skills`)
   - Input: build type, focus, selected gems
   - Algorithm:
     1. Filter skills by character class
     2. Score each skill based on:
        - Base effectiveness for build type
        - Synergy with selected gems
        - Focus alignment (e.g., DPS vs Survival)
        - Percentage-based improvements
        - Attack speed modifiers
     3. Select optimal skill combination
     4. Validate against class constraints
     5. Verify control/buff requirements

2. Equipment Selection (`_select_equipment`)
   - Input: build type, focus, gems, skills
   - Algorithm:
     1. Score equipment pieces based on:
        - Base stats alignment with focus
        - Synergies with gems and skills
        - Set bonuses potential
     2. Optimize set combinations
     3. Fill remaining slots with best-in-slot items

### Phase 2: Stats and Synergies

1. Stats Calculation (`_calculate_stats`)
   - Implement stat aggregation from:
     - Base stats
     - Gem bonuses
     - Equipment bonuses
     - Set bonuses
     - Skill modifiers
   - Calculate derived stats:
     - DPS metrics
     - Survival metrics
     - Utility metrics

2. Synergy Analysis (`_find_synergies`)
   - Implement synergy detection:
     - Gem-to-gem synergies
     - Gem-to-skill synergies
     - Skill-to-skill synergies
     - Equipment set synergies
   - Score synergy effectiveness
   - Identify anti-synergies

### Phase 3: Scoring Systems

1. Skill Scoring (`_calculate_skill_score`) 
   - Base score calculation based on skill type and build focus
   - Focus multiplier for build type alignment
   - Gem synergy bonus calculation
   - Cooldown impact consideration
   - Type-specific bonuses (control, mobility)
   - Percentage-based effect bonuses
   - Attack speed modifier bonuses
   - RAID-specific optimizations

2. Equipment Scoring (`_calculate_equipment_score`)
   ```python
   def _calculate_equipment_score(item, build, focus):
       stat_score = score_stats_alignment(item, focus)
       synergy_score = score_synergies(item, build)
       set_potential = evaluate_set_potential(item)
       return (stat_score * 0.4 + 
               synergy_score * 0.4 + 
               set_potential * 0.2)
   ```

3. Set Scoring (`_calculate_set_score`)
   ```python
   def _calculate_set_score(set_name, build):
       bonus_score = score_set_bonuses(set_name, build)
       synergy_score = score_set_synergies(set_name, build)
       return (bonus_score * 0.6 + synergy_score * 0.4)
   ```

### Phase 4: Optimization and Constraints

1. Build Constraints
   - Implement constraint checking:
     - Skill slot limits
     - Gem star rating compatibility
     - Equipment slot restrictions
     - Set piece combinations
     - Control/buff requirements
     - Mobility skill requirements

2. Build Optimization
   - Implement optimization strategies:
     - Set piece combination optimization
     - Gem slot allocation optimization
     - Skill loadout optimization
     - Equipment stat priority optimization
     - Build type specific optimizations
     - Percentage bonus maximization

### Phase 5: Inventory Integration

1. Inventory Adaptation
   - Modify selection algorithms to consider:
     - Available gems and their ranks
     - Available equipment pieces
     - Existing set combinations
     - Current skill loadout

2. Inventory Optimization
   - Implement inventory-aware optimization:
     - Maximize use of existing high-value items
     - Suggest minimal changes for improvement
     - Consider upgrade paths
     - Balance immediate vs long-term goals

## Implementation Details

### 1. Skill Selection System

#### Current Implementation (2025-01-04)
The skill selection system now properly validates:

1. Weapon Skills:
   - First skill must be a weapon skill
   - Uses weapon_slots from class constraints
   - Validates against available weapons

2. Secondary Skills:
   - Must be from available_skills list
   - Validates skill types:
     - At least one damage skill
     - At least one control or buff skill
     - At least one mobility skill (dash)

3. Data Structure:
   - Uses class-specific constraints
   - Properly structured skill registry
   - Includes skill type metadata

#### Next Steps
1. Equipment Selection:
   - Implement base equipment scoring
   - Add set bonus evaluation
   - Consider skill synergies

2. Stats Calculation:
   - Aggregate stats from all sources
   - Apply percentage modifiers
   - Calculate final values

3. Synergy Detection:
   - Implement skill-to-skill synergies
   - Add equipment-to-skill synergies
   - Consider gem interactions
