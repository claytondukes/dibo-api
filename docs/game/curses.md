# Curse System

## TODO Items

### Research Needed

- [ ] Document curse types and effects
- [ ] List curse application methods
- [ ] Document curse duration mechanics
- [ ] Explain curse resistance system
- [ ] List curse interactions with other systems
- [ ] Document curse cleansing mechanics

### Implementation Questions

1. What types of curses exist in the game?
2. How are curses applied and removed?
3. Do curses have different severity levels?
4. Are there class-specific curse interactions?
5. How do curses affect combat rating?
6. What defensive mechanics exist against curses?

### Data Structure Needs

- Curse definitions
- Application rules
- Duration mechanics
- Resistance calculations
- Cleansing systems

## Current Understanding

Basic system components that we know:

1. Curses appear to be debuff effects
2. May interact with specific gear or gem effects
3. Likely have duration and severity components
4. Probably have resistance or immunity mechanics

## API Considerations

When implementing curse-related features:

1. Track curse states
2. Calculate duration and effects
3. Handle resistance mechanics
4. Integrate with combat system
5. Consider cleansing mechanics
