# Auxiliary Gems in Diablo Immortal

## Core Mechanics

### Basic Rules

- An Auxiliary (Aux) gem can be inlaid into an equipped Legendary Gem
- The Aux gem REPLACES the primary gem's effect with the Aux gem's effect at Rank 1
- The primary gem's Resonance, Combat Rating, and Magic Find remain unchanged
- Only one of each Legendary Gem can be equipped at a time (including both primary and aux slots)

### Requirements

- Aux gems must match the star rating of the primary gem
  - 5★ gems can only use 5★ aux gems
  - 2★ gems can only use 2★ aux gems
  - 1★ gems can only use 1★ aux gems
- Cannot have duplicate gems in either primary or aux slots
  - Example: If BSJ is used as primary, it cannot be used as aux in another slot
  - Example: If Seeping Bile is used as aux, it cannot be used as primary in another slot

### Effect Mechanics

- Primary gem provides:
  - Full Resonance based on rank and quality
  - Full Combat Rating
  - Full Magic Find
  - All numeric stat bonuses
- Aux gem provides:
  - ONLY its effect at Rank 1
  - NO additional resonance
  - NO additional stats
  - NO additional Combat Rating

## Strategic Considerations

### PvE Usage

- Ideal for dungeons and rifts
- Allows testing new gem effects without losing resonance
- Good for situational effects that are valuable even at Rank 1
- Best used when the Rank 1 effect of the aux gem is more valuable than the Rank 10 effect of the primary

### PvP Considerations

- Generally not recommended for PvP
- High resonance from primary gems puts you in higher matchmaking brackets
- Rank 1 effects from aux gems may be too weak for these brackets
- Results in "empty resonance" - high matchmaking rating without corresponding power
- Might be worth using the Aux gem if the Rank 1 effect of the aux gem is more important than the primary

### Best Practices

1. Keep powerful scaling gems (like BSJ) as primary without aux
2. Use aux slots for gems whose effects are still valuable at Rank 1
3. Consider content type when choosing aux gems
4. Remember that aux effects are always Rank 1, regardless of primary gem's rank

## Example Combinations

- Primary BSJ (no aux) - Keep full damage scaling
- Primary Chip of Stoned Flesh + Aux BoTW - ONLY BoTW's R1 damage proc effect
- Primary Seeping Bile + Aux Phoenix Ashes - ONLY Phoenix Ashes R1 survival effect

## Detailed Example: Blessing of the Worthy with Roiling Aux

This example demonstrates exactly how aux gems work in practice:

### Roiling (Unslotted, in inventory)

- Rank 4, Quality 2
- Increases Resonance by 280
- +66 Combat Rating
- Effect: Dealing damage sends you into a roiling rage for 6 seconds, during which:
  - Critical Hit Chance increased by 24%
  - Critical hits cause fiery explosion (Burns for 36% base damage over 3s)
  - 3% increased Critical Hit Chance vs Burning enemies
  - 20s cooldown on rage effect

### BoTW (Without Aux)

- Rank 10, Quality 5
- Increases Resonance by 1000
- +240 Combat Rating
- Effect: 20% chance when taking damage to:
  - Deal 28% of current Life as damage to nearby enemies
  - Decrease all damage taken by 16% for 6s
  - 20s cooldown

### BoTW with Roiling as Aux

- Rank 10, Quality 5 (keeps primary gem's stats)
- Increases Resonance by 1000 (from primary)
- +240 Combat Rating (from primary)
- Effect: ONLY Roiling's Rank 1 effect:
  - Critical Hit Chance increased by 12% (note: Rank 1 value)
  - Critical hits cause fiery explosion (Burns for 36% base damage over 3s)
  - 20s cooldown on rage effect

Key Observations:

1. Resonance and CR from primary gem (BoTW) are preserved
2. Original BoTW effect is COMPLETELY replaced
3. Roiling effect is applied at Rank 1 values (12% crit vs 24% at R4)
4. Some secondary effects from Roiling R4 are not present in aux version (like 3% crit vs burning) because other effects are given at higher ranks, so they are not present in aux version

## Important Note About Effects

- When using an aux gem, the primary gem's effect is COMPLETELY REPLACED
- Only the Rank 1 effect of the aux gem will be active
- The primary gem contributes ONLY its resonance, CR, and MF
- There is NO combination of effects - you get ONLY the aux effect at Rank 1

## Notes

- Aux gem system allows for more build flexibility
- Creates opportunities for utility-focused gem effects without sacrificing resonance
- System is primarily designed for PvE and Raid content optimization
