# Reforge System

## TODO Items

### Research Needed

- [ ] Document reforge mechanics
- [ ] List reforge options
- [ ] Document reforge costs
- [ ] Explain reforge limitations
- [ ] List reforge outcomes
- [ ] Document optimal reforge strategies

### Implementation Questions

1. What properties can be reforged?
2. How are reforge options determined?
3. What are the resource costs?
4. Are there limitations per item?
5. How do reforges affect other modifications?
6. What's the relationship with combat rating?

### Data Structure Needs

- Reforge options
- Cost calculations
- Outcome possibilities
- Limitation rules
- Quality factors

## Current Understanding

Basic system components that we know:

1. Allows modification of item properties
2. Likely requires specific resources
3. May have quality/rarity factors
4. Probably has attempt limitations

## API Considerations

When implementing reforge-related features:

1. Track reforge history
2. Calculate costs and outcomes
3. Handle limitation rules
4. Integrate with gear system
5. Consider optimization paths
