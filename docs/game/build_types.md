# Build Types Configuration

This document describes the configuration structure for build types in the game. The configuration is stored in `data/indexed/build_types.json`.

## Overview

The build types configuration defines how different skills are scored based on their
type, description, and mechanics. This allows for flexible adjustment of build
generation without code changes.

## TODO: Build System Enhancements

### PvP Role Specialization
Current build system needs expansion to support:
1. **Role-Based Builds**
   - Pure Support (healing, buffing, crowd control)
   - Pure Damage (burst damage, sustained pressure)
   - Balanced (moderate damage + survival)
   - Survival Focus (high survival, utility)

2. **Build Factors to Implement**
   - Crowd control resistance
   - Burst damage potential
   - Healing output metrics
   - Survival metrics (effective health, damage mitigation)
   - Utility value (crowd control, buffs/debuffs)
   - Mobility score
   - Team synergy potential

3. **Scoring System Updates**
   - Add role-specific scoring weights
   - Implement survival vs damage tradeoff calculations
   - Add team composition considerations
   - Factor in meta-specific requirements

### Dynamic Build Types

The configuration supports dynamic build types, allowing users to define custom
build types beyond the standard raid, farm, and pvp types. For example:

```json
{
  "pvp_support": {
    "healing": {
      "terms": ["heal", "restore", "regenerate", "mend"],
      "score_weights": {
        "base_type_match": 0.4,
        "term_match": 0.3,
        "utility": {
          "cc_weight": 0.2,
          "buff_weight": 0.3,
          "mobility_weight": 0.1
        }
      }
    },
    "control": {
      "terms": ["stun", "freeze", "slow", "immobilize"],
      "score_weights": {
        "base_type_match": 0.4,
        "term_match": 0.3,
        "utility": {
          "cc_duration": 0.2,
          "cc_reliability": 0.3
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "pvp_damage": {
    "burst": {
      "terms": ["critical", "massive", "explosion", "burst"],
      "score_weights": {
        "base_type_match": 0.4,
        "term_match": 0.3,
        "damage": {
          "burst_potential": 0.3,
          "cooldown_sync": 0.2
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "pvp_survival": {
    "defensive": {
      "terms": ["shield", "barrier", "protect", "reduce damage"],
      "score_weights": {
        "base_type_match": 0.4,
        "term_match": 0.3,
        "survival": {
          "mitigation": 0.3,
          "recovery": 0.2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

When adding new build types:

1. Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `fast_farm`, `boss_raid`, `pvp_support`)
2. Define appropriate terms and weights
3. Consider cooldown thresholds for the specific use case
4. Document the new build type's purpose and scoring logic

## File Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "last_updated": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
  },
  "build_types": {
    "[build_type]": {
      "[focus]": {
        "terms": ["..."],
        "score_weights": {
          "base_type_match": float,
          "second_type_match": float,
          "term_match": float,
          "cooldown": {
            "threshold": int,
            "threshold_medium": int,
            "score": float,
            "score_medium": float
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration Fields

### Build Types

Each build type (raid, farm, pvp) can have multiple focuses:

- `raid`: Focused on boss fights and sustained damage
- `farm`: Optimized for efficient resource gathering
- `pvp`: Balanced for player versus player combat

### Focus Types

Each build type can have different focuses:

- `dps`: Damage dealing
- `survival`: Defense and sustain
- `buff`: Support and enhancement

### Scoring Configuration

#### Terms

Lists of keywords that, when found in skill descriptions, contribute to the skill's
score. Example:

```json
"terms": [
  "damage over time",
  "area damage",
  "nearby enemies"
]
```

#### Score Weights

Defines how different aspects contribute to the final skill score:

- `base_type_match`: Score for matching primary skill type (0.0-1.0)
- `second_type_match`: Score for matching secondary skill type (0.0-1.0)
- `term_match`: Score for matching terms in description (0.0-1.0)

#### Cooldown Configuration

Optional cooldown scoring parameters:

- `threshold`: Primary cooldown threshold in seconds
- `threshold_medium`: Secondary cooldown threshold in seconds
- `score`: Score for meeting primary threshold (0.0-1.0)
- `score_medium`: Score for meeting secondary threshold (0.0-1.0)

## Example Configuration

Here's an example for a raid DPS configuration:

```json
{
  "raid": {
    "dps": {
      "terms": [
        "damage over time",
        "area damage",
        "nearby enemies"
      ],
      "score_weights": {
        "base_type_match": 0.5,
        "second_type_match": 0.3,
        "term_match": 0.2,
        "cooldown": {
          "threshold": 15,
          "score": 0.2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The build service uses this configuration to score skills when generating builds:

1. Matches skill type against focus
2. Searches for terms in skill description
3. Evaluates cooldown thresholds
4. Combines scores using weights

## Maintenance

### Adding New Terms

When adding new terms:

1. Ensure terms match actual in-game text
2. Add terms that appear in skill descriptions
3. Keep terms specific and meaningful
4. Document term additions in changelog

### Adjusting Weights

When modifying weights:

1. Test changes with multiple builds
2. Keep total possible score â‰¤ 1.0
3. Document weight changes in changelog
4. Consider impact on existing builds
