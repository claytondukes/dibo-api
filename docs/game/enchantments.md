# Enchantment System

## TODO Items

### Research Needed

- [ ] Document enchantment types
- [ ] List enchantment sources
- [ ] Document enchantment levels
- [ ] Explain enchantment transfer system
- [ ] List enchantment limitations
- [ ] Document enchantment costs

### Implementation Questions

1. What types of enchantments exist?
2. How are enchantments applied?
3. Can enchantments be transferred?
4. Are there quality levels?
5. How do enchantments interact with other modifications?
6. What are the resource costs?

### Data Structure Needs

- Enchantment definitions
- Application rules
- Transfer mechanics
- Cost calculations
- Effect stacking rules

## Current Understanding

Basic system components that we know:

1. Enchantments modify gear properties
2. May have different quality levels
3. Likely requires specific resources
4. Probably has limitations per item

## API Considerations

When implementing enchantment-related features:

1. Track enchantment states
2. Calculate costs and effects
3. Handle transfer mechanics
4. Integrate with gear system
5. Consider optimization paths
