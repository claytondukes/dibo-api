  - Legendary essences
  - Legendary gem slots

  - Neck, Waist, Hands, Feet
  - Rings (2 slots)
  - Bracers (2 slots)
  - Normal gem sockets

### `gems.json`
Tracks all legendary gems you own:
- Organized by gem name
- Each gem can have multiple copies at different:
  - Ranks (1-10)
  - Quality levels (2-5/5 for 5â˜… gems)
  - Auxiliary (Aux) status

### `sets.json`
Lists all set items in your inventory:
- Organized by set name
- Each item includes:
  - Slot type
  - Attributes (strength, fortitude, willpower)
  - Socket count (2-3 per item)
  - Combat rating

### `builds.json`
Stores your saved builds:
- Each build has a name and complete equipment loadout
- References items from your inventory
- Tracks both gear and set items

## Setting Up Your Inventory

1. Create a new GitHub Gist at https://gist.github.com/
2. Create four files with the exact names: `profile.json`, `gems.json`, `sets.json`, and `builds.json`
3. Copy the contents of each file from this directory into your corresponding gist files
4. Update the contents to match your actual inventory:
   - Set your player info in `profile.json`
   - List your legendary gems in `gems.json`
   - Add your set items to `sets.json`
   - Create your builds in `builds.json`

## File Format Guidelines

1. Each file must be valid JSON
2. Keep the version and last_updated fields current
3. Follow the exact structure shown in the example files
4. For equipped items:
   - Legendary gems go in essence slots
   - Normal gems (ruby, sapphire, etc.) go in set item sockets
5. Set items always have 2-3 sockets when equipped

## Example Usage

```json
// profile.json - Example of equipped items
{
  "equipped": {
    "gear": {
      "chest": {
        "essence": null,

        "item": "Awakener's Urge",
        "sockets": 2
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Updating Your Inventory

1. Edit the appropriate gist file when you:
   - Get new items
   - Upgrade gems
   - Change equipped items
   - Create new builds
2. Always update the `last_updated` timestamp
3. Increment the `version` if you make structural changes
