# Skill Scoring Test Progress

## Current Status (2025-01-04)

### Passing Tests
- Basic skill validation ✅
- Maximum skill count validation ✅
- Cooldown distribution checks ✅
- Mobility requirement validation ✅
- Basic skill scoring ✅
- Basic essence scoring ✅
- Gem synergy scoring ✅
- DPS focus essence scoring ✅
- Percentage bonus scoring ✅
- Build type (RAID) scoring ✅

### Failing Tests
1. `test_validate_skill_selection_types`
   - Issue: Not properly detecting control/buff skills
   - Current: Allowing builds without control/buff skills
   - Expected: Should reject builds missing control/buff
   - Fix: Need to improve control/buff detection logic

2. `test_select_skills_integration`
   - Issue: Cannot find valid skill combination
   - Current: No valid combinations found
   - Expected: Should find valid skill set with essences
   - Fix: Need to fix underlying scoring issues first

## Recent Fixes

### 1. Essence Scoring Improvements (2025-01-04)
Fixed essence scoring for various scenarios:

1. DPS Focus Scoring:
   - Increased base score for damage skills from 0.3 to 0.4
   - Increased base score for percentage bonuses from 0.5 to 0.6
   - Increased base score for attack speed from 0.5 to 0.6
   - Added higher focus bonuses for percentage effects (0.4) and attack speed (0.4)

2. RAID Build Scoring:
   - Increased damage skill bonus from 0.3 to 0.4
   - Added extra bonus (0.3) for attack speed in raids
   - Added extra bonus (0.3) for percentage-based effects in raids
   - Set minimum score of 0.5 for damage skills in raids

3. Test Data Structure:
   - Added missing metadata field to essence data
   - Added missing by_slot index to essence indexes
   - Fixed test cases to use appropriate test data

### 2. Gem Synergy Scoring (2025-01-04)
Fixed the gem synergy scoring test by:
1. Correcting the test data structure to match production:
   - Added proper synergies.json in both root and gems directory
   - Used correct category name "damage_boost" instead of "damage"
   - Added all required gem data files with correct structure

2. Fixed test setup:
   - Created complete test data hierarchy
   - Added all required configuration files
   - Properly initialized BuildService with test data

3. Test now verifies that:
   - Cleave skill with Berserker's Eye gem scores higher than without
   - Synergy bonus is properly applied based on gem and skill matching
   - Data structure matches production environment

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining failing tests in order:
   - Skill type validation (control/buff detection)
   - Integration test for skill selection

2. For each test:
   - Review test data structure
   - Verify scoring logic
   - Update test expectations if needed
   - Document fixes and improvements

3. Additional improvements:
   - Consider adding more edge cases to test percentage bonuses
   - Add specific tests for attack speed bonuses
   - Review and update test documentation
   - Ensure all test data matches production structure
