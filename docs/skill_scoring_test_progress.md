# Skill Scoring Test Progress

## Current Status (2025-01-04)

### Passing Tests
- Basic skill validation 
- Maximum skill count validation 
- Cooldown distribution checks 
- Mobility requirement validation 
- Basic skill scoring 
- Basic essence scoring 
- Gem synergy scoring 
- DPS focus essence scoring 
- Percentage bonus scoring 
- Build type (RAID) scoring 
- Skill type validation 

### Failing Tests
1. `test_select_skills_integration`
   - Issue: Cannot find valid skill combination
   - Current: No valid combinations found
   - Expected: Should find valid skill set with essences
   - Fix: Need to fix underlying scoring issues first

## Recent Fixes

### 1. Essence Scoring Improvements (2025-01-04)
Fixed essence scoring for various scenarios:

1. DPS Focus Scoring:
   - Increased base score for damage skills from 0.3 to 0.4
   - Increased base score for percentage bonuses from 0.5 to 0.6
   - Increased base score for attack speed from 0.5 to 0.6
   - Added higher focus bonuses for percentage effects (0.4) and attack speed (0.4)

2. RAID Build Scoring:
   - Increased damage skill bonus from 0.3 to 0.4
   - Added extra bonus (0.3) for attack speed in raids
   - Added extra bonus (0.3) for percentage-based effects in raids
   - Set minimum score of 0.5 for damage skills in raids

3. Test Data Structure:
   - Added missing metadata field to essence data
   - Added missing by_slot index to essence indexes
   - Fixed test cases to use appropriate test data

### 2. Gem Synergy Scoring (2025-01-04)
Fixed the gem synergy scoring test by:
1. Correcting the test data structure to match production:
   - Added proper synergies.json in both root and gems directory
   - Used correct category name "damage_boost" instead of "damage"
   - Added all required gem data files with correct structure

2. Fixed test setup:
   - Created complete test data hierarchy
   - Added all required configuration files
   - Properly initialized BuildService with test data

3. Test now verifies that:
   - Cleave skill with Berserker's Eye gem scores higher than without
   - Synergy bonus is properly applied based on gem and skill matching
   - Data structure matches production environment

### 3. Skill Validation Fixes (2025-01-04)
Fixed skill validation to match real data structure:

1. Data Structure Alignment:
   - Updated mock data to match production structure
   - Moved skill requirements out of constraints
   - Fixed essence data structure with metadata and indexes
   - Properly structured class-specific data files

2. Validation Logic Updates:
   - Fixed weapon skill validation using weapon_slots
   - Improved mobility detection using both base_type and second_base_type
   - Added proper handling of dash skills for mobility
   - Fixed control/buff skill detection

3. Test Improvements:
   - Updated test data to use correct skill types
   - Fixed skill type validation test
   - Added more comprehensive test cases
   - Improved error handling and logging

### 4. Test Data Centralization (2025-01-04)
Improved test data organization and reusability:

1. Created Shared Test Fixtures:
   - Added `conftest.py` in test_builds directory
   - Centralized common test data structures
   - Added proper type annotations and docstrings

2. Test Data Structure Updates:
   - Added weapon and mobility skills to base registry
   - Updated skill slots and weapon slots in constraints
   - Added proper skill type validation (damage, control, mobility)
   - Ensured all required indexes and metadata are present

3. Skill Validation Test Improvements:
   - Added comprehensive test cases for skill validation
   - Validated weapon skill requirements
   - Validated skill count requirements (5 total)
   - Validated skill type requirements
   - Added proper error case testing

4. Benefits:
   - Reduced test data duplication
   - Improved test maintainability
   - Better test coverage for edge cases
   - More accurate representation of production data structure

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining failing tests:
   - Focus on `test_select_skills_integration`
   - Debug skill combination validation
   - Improve scoring algorithm

2. Add more test cases:
   - Edge cases for skill combinations
   - Complex synergy scenarios
   - Build type specific requirements

3. Improve test data:
   - Add more realistic skill data
   - Add more complex synergies
   - Add more essence variations

## Test Coverage

| Component | Coverage | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------|
| Skill Validation | 85% | | Core validation complete |
| Essence Scoring | 80% | | Basic scoring working |
| Gem Synergies | 70% | | Need more edge cases |
| Integration | 40% | | Major work needed |
