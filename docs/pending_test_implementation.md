# Pending Test Implementation Plan

## Purpose
This document tracks tests that need to be implemented for the build generation system. As tests are implemented and verified working, they should be moved to `build_generation_plan.md` under the appropriate section.

## Overview
The following tests need to be implemented using the new indexed data structure. Each test should be moved to `build_generation_plan.md` once it is implemented and passing.

## Skill Selection Tests

### Basic Skill Validation
1. `test_validate_skill_exists`
   - Verify skill exists in class registry
   - Test with valid and invalid skill names
   - Check error handling for unknown skills

2. `test_validate_skill_requirements`
   - Check level requirements
   - Verify class restrictions
   - Test prerequisite skills

### Skill Selection Logic
1. `test_select_skills_by_build_type`
   - Test PVP build skill selection
   - Test RAID build skill selection
   - Verify appropriate skill type distribution

2. `test_select_skills_by_focus`
   - Test DPS focus skill priorities
   - Test SURVIVAL focus skill priorities
   - Test BUFF focus skill priorities

3. `test_skill_cooldown_distribution`
   - Verify mix of short/medium/long cooldowns
   - Check cooldown category limits
   - Test cooldown synergies

4. `test_skill_type_requirements`
   - Verify minimum damage skills
   - Check control skill requirements
   - Test mobility skill inclusion

### Essence Integration
1. `test_essence_skill_compatibility`
   - Verify essence matches skill
   - Test essence slot restrictions
   - Check essence availability

2. `test_essence_scoring`
   - Test DPS essence scoring
   - Test survival essence scoring
   - Test utility essence scoring
   - Verify essence synergies with build focus

### Gem Integration
1. `test_gem_skill_synergies`
   - Test gem effects on skill selection
   - Verify gem bonus calculations
   - Check gem-skill compatibility

### Advanced Selection Tests
1. `test_skill_synergy_optimization`
   - Test skill combinations
   - Verify synergy bonuses
   - Check conflict resolution

2. `test_build_specific_requirements`
   - Test class-specific requirements
   - Verify build type constraints
   - Check focus-specific needs

## Equipment Selection Tests
(Already implemented in test_equipment_selection.py)

## Integration Tests

### Full Build Generation
1. `test_generate_complete_build`
   - Test end-to-end build generation
   - Verify all components work together
   - Check build consistency

2. `test_build_optimization`
   - Test overall build scoring
   - Verify component synergies
   - Check build effectiveness

### Error Handling
1. `test_invalid_build_requests`
   - Test invalid class/type combinations
   - Check error handling
   - Verify error messages

## Test Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Core Functionality
1. Basic skill validation tests
2. Skill selection by build type
3. Skill selection by focus
4. Cooldown distribution tests

### Phase 2 - Integration Features
1. Essence compatibility tests
2. Gem synergy tests
3. Skill synergy optimization

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features
1. Full build generation tests
2. Build optimization tests
3. Error handling tests

## Notes
- Each test should use real data from the indexed files
- Tests should be independent and idempotent
- Mock data should be minimal and based on actual data structure
- Focus on testing one aspect per test
- Include both positive and negative test cases
