# Build Skill Scoring Tests

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation and testing status of the build skill scoring system, which is responsible for selecting and optimizing skill and essence combinations for character builds.

## Test Status (2025-01-04)

### ✅ Passing Tests

1. Basic Validation:
   - Basic skill validation
   - Maximum skill count validation
   - Cooldown distribution checks
   - Mobility requirement validation

2. Scoring Systems:
   - Basic skill scoring
   - Basic essence scoring
   - Gem synergy scoring
   - DPS focus essence scoring
   - Percentage bonus scoring
   - Build type (RAID) scoring
   - Skill type validation

### ❌ Known Issues

1. Integration Test: `test_select_skills_integration`
   ```python
   def test_select_skills_integration():
       # FAILING: Cannot find valid skill combination
       # Current: No valid combinations found
       # Expected: Should find valid skill set with essences
   ```
   - Root cause: Underlying scoring issues need to be fixed first
   - Priority: High
   - Status: In Progress

## Recent Improvements

### 1. DPS Focus Scoring
Updated scoring weights for better DPS optimization:
```python
DPS_FOCUS_WEIGHTS = {
    'damage_skills': 0.4,  # Increased from 0.3
    'percentage_bonus': 0.6,  # Increased from 0.5
    'attack_speed': 0.6,  # Increased from 0.5
    'focus_bonus': {
        'percentage_effects': 0.4,
        'attack_speed': 0.4
    }
}
```

### 2. RAID Build Scoring
Enhanced RAID-specific scoring:
```python
RAID_BUILD_WEIGHTS = {
    'damage_skills': 0.4,  # Increased from 0.3
    'attack_speed_bonus': 0.3,  # New
    'percentage_effects_bonus': 0.3,  # New
    'minimum_damage_score': 0.5  # New
}
```

### 3. Test Data Structure
Improved test data organization:
```
test_data/
├── essences/
│   ├── metadata.json
│   └── indexes/
│       ├── by_slot.json
│       └── by_skill.json
├── gems/
│   ├── synergies.json
│   └── data/
└── skills/
    └── barbarian/
        ├── base_skills.json
        └── constraints.json
```

## Test Implementation Details

### 1. Gem Synergy Scoring
```python
def test_gem_synergy_scoring():
    """Test gem synergy scoring system.
    
    Verifies:
    1. Cleave + Berserker's Eye scores higher than base
    2. Synergy bonus properly applied
    3. Data structure matches production
    """
    build_service = BuildService(test_data_dir)
    score_with_gem = build_service.score_skill(
        skill="Cleave",
        gem="Berserker's Eye"
    )
    score_without_gem = build_service.score_skill(
        skill="Cleave"
    )
    assert score_with_gem > score_without_gem
```

### 2. Skill Validation
```python
def test_skill_validation():
    """Test skill validation logic.
    
    Verifies:
    1. Weapon skill requirements
    2. Mobility skill detection
    3. Control/buff balance
    4. Skill type validation
    """
    valid_skills = [
        "Frenzy",  # Weapon
        "Cleave",  # Damage
        "Ground_Stomp",  # Control
        "Leap",  # Mobility
        "Whirlwind"  # Damage
    ]
    assert build_service.validate_skills(valid_skills)
```

## Test Coverage

### Core Components
1. Skill Selection:
   - Weapon skill validation
   - Mobility requirements
   - Control/buff balance
   - Damage distribution

2. Scoring System:
   - Base skill scoring
   - Essence modifications
   - Gem synergies
   - Build type modifiers

3. Data Validation:
   - Skill existence
   - Valid combinations
   - Data structure integrity

### Edge Cases
1. Invalid Inputs:
   - Missing skills
   - Invalid combinations
   - Unknown skills
   - Wrong skill types

2. Data Issues:
   - Missing metadata
   - Invalid indexes
   - Corrupt data files
   - Version mismatches

## Next Steps

1. Week of 2025-01-11:
   - Fix integration test failures
   - Improve scoring accuracy
   - Add more edge cases
   - Performance optimization

2. Week of 2025-01-18:
   - Documentation updates
   - API examples
   - Code cleanup
