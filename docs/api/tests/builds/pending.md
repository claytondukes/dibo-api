# Pending Build Test Implementation

## Overview

This document tracks tests that still need to be implemented for the build generation system. For implemented tests, see:
- [builds.md](./builds.md) - Core build generation tests
- [skill_scoring.md](./skill_scoring.md) - Skill scoring and validation tests

## Pending Tests

### Skill Selection Tests

#### Advanced Selection Tests
1. `test_skill_synergy_optimization`
   - Test skill combinations
   - Verify synergy bonuses
   - Check conflict resolution
   - Status: Not Started
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Skill scoring system

2. `test_build_specific_requirements`
   - Test class-specific requirements
   - Verify build type constraints
   - Check focus-specific needs
   - Status: Implemented
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None
   - Documentation: [requirements.md](./requirements.md)

### Integration Tests

#### Full Build Generation
1. `test_generate_complete_build`
   - Test end-to-end build generation
   - Verify all components work together
   - Check build consistency
   - Status: In Progress
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: Equipment selection

2. `test_build_optimization`
   - Test overall build scoring
   - Verify component synergies
   - Check build effectiveness
   - Status: Not Started
   - Priority: Medium
   - Dependencies: Synergy optimization

### Error Handling
1. `test_invalid_build_requests`
   - Test invalid class/type combinations
   - Check error handling
   - Verify error messages
   - Status: In Progress
   - Priority: High
   - Dependencies: None

## Implementation Schedule

## Notes

1. Already Implemented:
   - Basic skill validation 
   - Skill selection by build type 
   - Skill selection by focus 
   - Cooldown distribution 
   - Equipment selection
